# HideCoords

A simple resource pack that hides coordinates, even if they are turned on in the world settings - useful if you're on a realm or world with them turned on and you want them off for yourself, but still on for others (e.g. while recording/streaming on a realm).

To use it, simply download and open the [release artifact](https://github.com/TheDragonRing/hidecoords/releases).

_For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, iOS, Android + more...)_
